# Solar Energy Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the **Solar Energy Analysis Dashboard** project! This app allows you to explore and analyze solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The goal is to gain insights from solar metrics and help identify high-potential regions for solar installations.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze solar data like irradiance, wind speed, temperature, and more.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize data with dynamic charts and user-friendly filters using Streamlit.
- **Data Insights**: Identify trends, correlations, and patterns for better solar energy investment decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly**: For data visualization.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive dashboard.
- **GitHub**: For version control.
